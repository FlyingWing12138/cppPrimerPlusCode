# C++ Primer Plus Code Listings and Exercises

本人自学C++ Primer Plus 做编程习题的时候找了个别人的github仓库作为参考，结果做到第7章发现那哥们坑了，不得已就把自己的代码传上来以供后人参考。（但我也不保证我不会坑。）

When I was learning _C++ Primer Plus_ by myself and working on the programming exercises, I found someone else's GitHub repo to use as a reference. 
But by the time I got to Chapter 7, I realized the guy hadn’t kept the repo updated. 
So, I had no choice but to upload my own code to help others out. (Though, no promises I won’t drop my balls either!)
